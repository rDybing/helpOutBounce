# Tutorial on Bounce2 library

Shows how to use the Bounce2.h library together with a small servo and a LED.

Main Sequence:

- Initialize all components.
- Check for button hit
- Update servo position if applicable

Pretty basic stuff showing how one delegates tasks out to functions rather than do a giant main-loop.
